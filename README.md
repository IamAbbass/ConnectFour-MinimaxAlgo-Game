Connect Four - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Implementation with Minimax Algorithm

# Content:
Are you looking for an exciting game that challenges your strategic thinking? Look no further! Introducing my latest project, "Connect Four," a popular two-player board game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by the formidable Minimax algorithm.

# Overview:
Connect Four, also known as Four in a Row, is a classic game where two players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The objective is to connect four of your discs in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, before your opponent does. This project demonstrates my passion for game development and showcases my proficiency in front-end web technologies.

# Key Features:

Interactive Gameplay: The game offers a smooth and interactive interface, allowing players to place their discs with a simple click.

Responsive Design: Whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, the game adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience.

Minimax Algorithm: Under the hood, the game employs the Minimax algorithm, a powerful decision-making technique commonly used in two-player games. This AI-driven approach ensures a challenging and engaging experience for players.

Game State Management: The application efficiently manages the game state, enabling players to undo moves and review the progression of the match.

Winning Animations: Celebrate your victories with delightful winning animations that bring an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay.

# Technical Details:
The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my proficiency in these front-end technologies. Leveraging the power of the Minimax algorithm, the game AI analyzes potential moves and selects the best one, providing a worthy opponent for players to compete against.

# Lessons Learned:
Developing Connect Four with the Minimax algorithm presented numerous challenges and learning opportunities. I gained valuable insights into artificial intelligence, game state management, and optimizing front-end performance for a smooth gaming experience.

# Future Improvements:
While I'm proud of the current implementation, there's always room for enhancement. In the future, I plan to explore additional features, such as difficulty levels for the AI, multiplayer functionality, and integrating sound effects to further elevate the user experience.

# Conclusion:
Connect Four is a testament to my dedication to learning and growing as a web developer. The combination of interactive gameplay, Minimax algorithm integration, and responsive design showcases my ability to deliver engaging and polished web-based projects.

Feel free to check out the live demo of "Connect Four" in action and explore the source code on my GitHub repository. I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed developing it!
